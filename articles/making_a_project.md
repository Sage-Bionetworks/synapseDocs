# What is a Synapse Project? 

Synapse `Projects` are online workspaces where researchers can collaborate and organize their work, regardless of whether they're working independently, collaborating in small working groups, or sharing their research across large consortia working together to solve big problems. Here are just a few things you can do with a Synapse Project: 

* **Organize Your Work**: With Synapse you can organize the parts in your workflow (data, code, etc) into a hierarchy like a file system. With the tabs across the top of each project, you can easily navigate to your [Wikis](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/wikis.html), [Files and Folders](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/files_and_versioning.html), SQL-based [Tables](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/tables.html), and even conduct conversations using [Discussion Forums](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/discussion.html). 

* **Store Data, Code, &amp; Results**: You can upload your data, code, and results to Synapse, or store a reference to where they are on your local computer system. These digital assets can be stored as Files, hosted by Synapse or in your own external cloud storage, or using [Docker Containers](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/docker.html). 

* **Control Access or Release Your Work Publicly**: You have complete fine-grained control over how users and groups can interact with your work. Work privately or collaborate openly, and everything in between.

* **Custom, Searchable Annotations**: Assign any key/value pair you want, and those values become searchable and available to those granted access to see.

* **Full Programmatic API &amp; R Integration**: Synapse is built on a REST API, so you can interact with Synapse using any programming language. We have built out full featured clients for R and Java. 

* **Attach Figures and Documents**: Upload documents and images via the website or programmatically.

* **Describe &amp; Version**: Describe each of the elements in your workflow, and then version those when you see fit. This allows you to explicitly record which version of the code you ran on which version of the data.

* **Create Links &amp; See Usage**: See some data stored elsewhere on Synapse? Make a link to store it in your project. Want to see what projects are using your data? They are displayed automatically.

## Create Your First Project

You can create a project from your Profile page; visit this page by clicking on your name in the header of Synapse once you've logged in. You'll see your profile as well as tabs for Projects, Teams, and Settings (and Challenges, if you've joined any). When you are on the Projects tab, click on Create a New Project. You'll be prompted to enter your project name to get started. 

Visit our [Getting Started](/articles/getting_started.html) guide for more information how to begin using Synapse.
