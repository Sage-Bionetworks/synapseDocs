### About Accounts, Certification and Qualified Researchers
There are three levels of user credentials in Synapse: anonymous, registered, and certified. 
The table below summarizes the user privileges for each level.  

<table class="markdown-table border text-align-center">
<tr><th></th><th>  Anonymous  </th><th> Registered  </th><th> Certified</th></tr>
<tr><td>Browse Public Project Catalog  </td><td>  X </td><td>  X  </td><td> X </td></tr>
<tr><td>Browse Public File Catalog  </td><td>  X </td><td>  X  </td><td> X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Create a Project  </td><td>    </td><td>  X  </td><td> X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add Wiki Content  </td><td>    </td><td>  X  </td><td> X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Download Files/Tables* </td><td>    </td><td>  X  </td><td> X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Upload Files/Tables </td><td>    </td><td>    </td><td> X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add Provenance </td><td>    </td><td>     </td><td> X</td></tr>
</table>


A user's ability to download files/tables depends on his/her credentials and, additionally, on the user fulfilling the _Conditions for Use_ of the file/table they wish to access. For example, some files/tables may require you to complete and sign a Data Use Agreement prior to download. 

## Anonymous user
Anyone can browse Synapse anonymously to review the platform features and resources, including the catalog of public `Projects` and `Files/Tables`. However, anonymous users cannot create `Projects` in Synapse nor can they upload or download `Files` or `Tables`. 

## Registered user

Registered Synapse users can create `Projects` and `Wikis`. They can collaborate with other registered Synapse users and create teams. Registered users can download open access content like data, code, and results, and request access to Controlled Use content. Access to Controlled Use content is granted to investigators who fulfill additional conditions as described in the 'Conditions for Use' for that content.

## Certified user

Certified users are authorized to use the full Synapse functionality. In order to ensure that users wishing to interact more freely within Synapse are familiar with the [Synapse Commons Data Use Procedure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf?v=4), **users must pass a short quiz (15 questions, approximately 20 minutes) to become Synapse certified.**

## Qualified researchers
A Synapse Qualified Researcher is a _**Certified User**_ with a _**validated user profile**_.  Synapse Qualified Researchers are eligible to request access to Bridge data (data collected in research studies conducted via self-guided mobile applications.) 

_**Become a Synapse certified user**_. Follow the instructions above to become a Synapse Certified user. 

_**Get your profile validated**_.  Go to your user profile page (click your name/picture on upper banner of the screen to get there) and use the links in the purple validation box:

1.	Confirm your user profile is complete (your full name, current affiliation, and city/country)
2.	Link to your ORCID profile (make sure your profile is public and populate it with at least one piece of information about yourself)
3.	Sign the Oath
4.	Submit validation documentation to the Synapse Access and Compliance team. Acceptable forms of documentation, in English, are:
     •	    A letter from a signing official on letterhead attesting to your identity (template here) OR
     •	    A notarized letter attesting to your identity (template here) OR
     •	    A copy of your professional license (e.g., a photocopy of your medical license)
Please note that a copy of a work identification badge is not an accepted form of identity documentation.

You will receive a notification email once your account information has been verified and a badge will appear on your Synapse profile page.
